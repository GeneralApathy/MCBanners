#How does it works

By making a request to the Minecraft-ITALIA's APIs (https://api.minecraft-italia.it) the application gets informations
about the desired server.
You can get the position, the IP and the name on the Minecraft-ITALIA's server list (https://minecraft-italia.it/lista-server-italiani).
